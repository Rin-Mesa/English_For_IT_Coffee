                    <ul>
                        <li>Heavy foot traffic – you want people walking by constantly</li>

                    <p>Around 1,000-1,500 sq ft works great (seating, kitchen, storage, bathroom). Don't go too small –
                        you need room to move around during rush hour.</p>

                        ingredients. Don't use cheap beans – customers can taste the difference.</p>
